    The UVIC Stem Cell Club aims to improve the quality and quantity of membership on Canadaâ€™s stem cell donor database - maintained by the Canadian Blood Services.
    Our work improves the chances that patients in-need of stem cell transplantation will find the one match they need to save their lives!

    If you are not in Canada - you can still donate thru your national stem cell registry.
